# EKF-ST
EKF-ST stands for extended Kalman filter with sequential thresholding. An algorithm for simultaneous and recursive state estimation and equation learning.
Numerical experiments are carried out for the Lorenz system with
- full state observation with 1 and linear candidate basis functions
- partial state observation with 1, linear, and corss-term candidate basis functions
- comparison to SINDy and ordinary EKF with augmented state
